    "Since the methods are mathematically equivalent, there should be no difference in the values; _so why is there an error in the $y$ components?_ The very small difference in the $y$ components of the velocity vectors is due to rounding and representation errors in a computer. We are storing the numbers as [_floating points_](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) (floats) and the computer only stores a fixed number of digits per number (it uses 64 bits). This means that during each operation with floats precision errors can occur. When calculating the final velocity with _SUVAT_ we only use three operations, but for the _Euler method_ we use $2\\times 10\\,000$ operations leading to a miniscule difference in the numerical result due to this error, although both methods are mathematically equivalent!\n",
